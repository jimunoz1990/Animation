Animation
=========

CS 274C Animation project

Basic Idea:

Implement a physics-based simulation of a tire (attached to a car) going around a race track.

Details and challenges for the simulation:
-Physically simulate the rotation of the tires, as well as the forces generated by the torque 
to move the car in the appropriate direction

-Texturing is going to be a big deal, we are going to have to apply textures to the wheel to make 
it look realistic, as well as the car.
    -If we can figure out how to import blender models into directX this won't be as hard.

-Texturing of the course will also be a challenge in terms of just partitioning the sections to 
texture and apply our physical constraints.

-Mud patch - create many small mud particles that will be physically simulated and whatnot

-Isolation of the wheel for the intoductory animation and ending animation.
